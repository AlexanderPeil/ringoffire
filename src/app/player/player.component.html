<div class="player" [class.player-active]="playerActive">
    <img src="../../assets/img/profile.png">
        <span>{{ name }}</span>
</div>


<!-- This section defines a <div> element with the CSS class "player". 
The [class.player-active] binding is used to conditionally add the CSS class "player-active" to the <div> element based on the value of the playerActive property.

Inside the <div> element, there is an <img> element that displays a profile image. 
The src attribute is set to "../../assets/img/profile.png", indicating the path to the profile image file.

Next, there is a <span> element that displays the value of the name property. 
The {{ name }} expression is used to bind the value of the name property dynamically.

Overall, this code represents a player element with a profile image and a name, and the "player-active" class is conditionally applied based on the playerActive property. -->
