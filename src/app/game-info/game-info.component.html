<!-- This section creates a card using the <mat-card> component. 
Inside the card, there is a <mat-card-title> element that displays the title and a <mat-card-content> element that displays the content.
The {{ card ? title : 'Please pick a card' }} expression is used to conditionally display the title based on the value of the card variable. 
If card has a truthy value, it displays the value of the title variable. Otherwise, it displays the string 'Please pick a card'.
Similarly, the {{ card ? description : 'Please click on the card stack to select the next card.' }} 
expression conditionally displays the content based on the value of the card variable. If card has a truthy value, it displays the value of the description variable. 
Otherwise, it displays the string 'Please click on the card stack to select the next card.'
Overall, this code creates a card component with a dynamic title and content based on the card variable. -->
